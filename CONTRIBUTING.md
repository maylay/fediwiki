To contribute to the project, make a merge request at <https://github.com/mitchellurgero/fediwiki>.  Alternatively if you want to 
contribute from elsewhere (e.g. Github, Bitbucket, personal repo, etc.) you need to clone the repo to your choice of version control and then submit a PR.  Once merged, the changes
will take effect on the live server within an hour after they're pushed to the repo.

This wiki is made up of Markdown files.  [Here's a good reference for the Markdown syntax.](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/)
To create a new page, simply make a new file with a .md extension and use whatever text editor you prefer.  Preferrably the files should use
UNIX-style line endings (just newline chracters and no carriage returns).
